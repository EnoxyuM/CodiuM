##  Advanced Features

### Code Injection

```javascript
//<<FILE_NAME
```

This feature literally lets you add content of any Tab into another. Using this you can easily break your code into small pices.

For example, create `some.js` file and paste here any function or variable from your main file:
```javascript
// main.js
//<<some.js
console.log("yo " + x + Y);
```

You can "import" it into your `main.js` file like this:
```javascript
// some.js
let x = 10;
const Y = 5;
function someFoo() { x = x * Y; }
// a lot of functions and initializations moved here from main file
```
It is very useful if you need to make code smaller without breaking it

The live preview will process this and execute the code as if `some.js` was written directly inside `main.js`. The system also detects and prevents circular dependencies.

### Project & Settings Management

*   **Projects:** All your code is saved in your browser's **IndexedDB**. This means your work is persistent across browser sessions on the same machine.

*   **Editor Theme:** Your custom color preferences are saved in **LocalStorage**. You can export these settings via the `Export` button in the color picker menu to back them up or share them.
